        <p>To build the world’s largest environmental movement to drive transformative change for people and planet.</p>

          <h2>OUR VISION FOR CHANGE</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="col-7">Our world needs transformational change.
          It’s time for the world to hold sectors accountable for their role in our environmental crisis while also calling for bold,
          creative, and innovative solutions. This will require action at all levels, from business and investment to city and national government.
          That’s where you come in: As an individual, you yield real power and influence as a consumer, a voter, and a member of a community that can unite for change.
          Don’t underestimate your power. When your voice and your actions are united with thousands or millions of others around the world, we create a movement that
         is inclusive, impactful, and impossible to ignore.

                <br>

                <p>With our partner organizations, ACT NOW provides civic engagement opportunities at the local, state, national and global levels around the world. Recognizing that climate change impacts vulnerable and marginalized communities first and most severely, EDN often works with low-income communities to bring their voices and issues into the movement.</p>

                <h2>Broaden</h2>
                <br>

                <p>At every turn, ACT NOW works to broaden the definition of “environment” to include issues that affect our health and our communities, such as greening deteriorated schools, creating green jobs and investment, and promoting activism to stop air and water pollution.</p>

                <br>

                <p>In the 50 years since that first Earth Day, ACT NOW has created civically oriented innovative programs with partners both inside and outside of the environmental movement to tackle new challenges. Our environmental campaigns mobilize individuals around the world on issues from voter registration to environmental education.</p>
